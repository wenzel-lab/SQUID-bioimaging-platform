# SiMoRa - SQUID Microscope with Raman [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)
Our open hardware bioimaging platform for fluorescence microscopy and Raman spectroscopy based on the SQUID/OCTOPI 60x60mm inverted microscopy stage

## What is the SQUID Microscope?
Squid (Simplifying Quantitive Imaging Development and Deployment) provides a full suite of hardware and software components for rapidly configuring high-performance microscopes tailored to users' applications with reduced cost, effort and turnaround time. Besides increasing accessibility of research microscopes and available microscope hours to labs, it is also designed to simplify development and dissemination of new or otherwise advanced microscopy techniques. Applications include slide scanner for digital pathology, time lapse imaging with 2D or 3D tiling, spatial omics that involves multicolor and multi-round imaging, tracking microscopy,computational microscopy, including label free microscopy using phase/polarization/reflectance + deep learning, and super resolution microscopy.

Inspired by the [Benchtop mesoSPIM light sheet microscope](https://github.com/mesoSPIM/benchtop-hardware/tree/main), we have incorporated the [ZWO-asto mini electronic filter wheel (EFW)](https://www.zwoastro.com/product/efw/) with the following filter selections:
| Position | Filter | Type | supplier |

* Laser-driver board [FL591FL Evaluation PCB & FL500 Laser Diode Driver](https://www.teamwavelength.com/product/fl591fl-evaluation-pcb-fl500-laser-diode-driver/?srsltid=AfmBOoozVTAnHhwxmi-iK4C9aj5j4m46LKKndWX-x-GoR4wqOxvL3puJ)

Questions:
* What peltier element? (size, voltage, position, connector?)
* laser "clamshell" screw holes don't fit onto the laser mounting plate - where to mount?
* Software for laser engine
* Connectors for laser engine
* Where to connect 12V PSU to laser engine
* Where to mount laser driver on laser engine?
* How/where to mount "DC 12v 3a 4pin PMW PC CPU fan temperature controll thermostat speed controller" (ZHIYU, ZF1X4L) and how many of the three units do I use?
  
needed:
* 2x imperial 2-56 screws (ca. 5mm) to fix the laser head to the laser "clamshell"
